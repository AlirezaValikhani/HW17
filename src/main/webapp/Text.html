<p>Now that you'r an <b>HTML5 ninja</b>,it's time for you to show us what you can do.Have a look at the html files we created throughout the course as<br>
reference.Now go and try making your own website with just HTML5! Once you are done, share your website with the slack community and<br>
fellow students of this course! I will also be checking the #html channel with any new submissions. You can send your files as a message or wait<br>
until later on in the course where I show  you how to put it online for free.<br><br>
<b>I will be picking my favourite ones and showcasing them in a future video in the course.</b><br><br>
    Good luck!</p>
